# 3D_cells

This directory: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D908lQjfWYdWytq3Tmw-cW1JjEtNPeaG?usp=sharing
should be called I05_multiOrganelles_Linked

Located at the same level as "Classes.py" and "examples.ipynb"

"examples.ipynb" calls classes from "Classes.py"

"Classes.py" provides comments covering how each function works

"{}_testing_ground.ipynb" should be ignored - I will continue to develop in there and improve "Classes" as necessary

As of 04/03/2022:

New folder of organelles should be located at same level as I05 file
Follow last 3 cells of 04032022_umap.ipynb

You can change them as you need (for organelle/for cell number) - I've only tested it on cytoplasm. I'm not sure what will happen if you have a cell which has cytoplam subset but not nucleus etc. 

This branch will no longer work on I05 folder (the reason for this is because the cytoplasm files are named differently - you can go into classes and change cytoplasm.p to cytoplasm.t to make it work)
