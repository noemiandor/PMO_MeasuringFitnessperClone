This directory: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D908lQjfWYdWytq3Tmw-cW1JjEtNPeaG?usp=sharing
should be called I05_multiOrganelles_Linked

Located at the same level as "Images_Classes.py" and "plotting_examples.ipynb"

"plotting_examples.ipynb" calls classes from "Images_Classes.py"

"Images_Classes.py" provides comments covering how each function works

"testing_ground.ipynb" should be ignored - I will continue to develop in there and improve "Images_Classes" as necessary
