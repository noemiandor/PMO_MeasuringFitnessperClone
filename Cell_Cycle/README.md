should be called I05_multiOrganelles_Linked

Located at the same level as "Classes.py" and "examples.ipynb"

"examples.ipynb" calls classes from "Classes.py"

"Images_Classes.py" provides comments covering how each function works

"{}_testing_ground.ipynb" should be ignored - I will continue to develop in there and improve "Classes" as necessary
